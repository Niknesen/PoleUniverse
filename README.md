Competition assessment application

The program was created by order of Royal Pole Dance Ltd. for refereeing sport competitions with a large number of participants, categories and judges with integration into Google Sheets. The judges are provided with an interface for instant evaluation of the sportsmen, and the organizers have administrative access to the base of ratings and ranking of participants in various nominations.
